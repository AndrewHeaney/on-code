This post is going to be a bit of a ramble about side projects. 

I have been thinking a lot recently about side projects and more specifically about what I should work on. There seems to be a constant flow of ideas and noise in my head around what I could build. I like to write these ideas down when I stumble apon them. I get very excited about the prospect of working on something new, that feeling that it could be something great. However, this feeling can usually be crushed with a couple of Google searches, discovering that my great idea already exists and it would be pointless to try and create my own version of it. But maybe this is the wrong perspective, after all what actually is the point in side projects?

## The point of side projects

In my opinion there are various different purposes of side projects, from a simple learning exercise to grasp a new concept, to something that could turn into a fully fledeged business and more. I do not believe there is one true purpose of side projects. My main use of side projects is to learn something new. There is no better way to learn how to do something than by doing it. If you want to create a website, create a website, if you want to build a game or a new tool, just build it. For example, I wanted to learn how to make a browser extension that can check if any website I visited had a Unidays student discount. I had no idea how to do this so I just started Googling. From this I discovered how to create APIs and how to interact with databases to serve data to users. I was able to create a working product that currently has 860 users in 50+ countries:

## Is it worth working on?

I ask myself this often. Is this thing I am working on right now or considering starting worthwhile? Is it going to be my big break, the next Facebook, Instagram, etc? Probably not, but that does not really matter. If you learn something from working on a project then it was worthwhile, doesn't matter how substantial the learning was, as long as you know more than you did before starting. 

I need to start reminding myself of this fact. I need to stop looking at all projects as potential ways to make money and more as ways to learn new skills that will eventually help me make something of value. I need to work on "boring", low-level tasks that would not seem at all interesting to a non-tech, but will teach me vast amounts of intricate details about areas I am interested in. Projects such as: building an HTTP client from scratch in a language I have never used before such as Go, creating my own basic search engine to learn about indexing and sorting data and contributing to an open source project that I use on a daily basis for development. 

These projects will ultimately make me a better engineer and help me to think for myself instead of following cookie cutter todo list tutorials.

## Conclusion

To conclude, I believe that you should work on whatever will give you the most enjoyment and help you to learn the most. Do not aim to make money, but hope that your projects may one day give you a return in some form, even if that is just helping you with your next project. Do not worry if the thing you are building is "interesting" to other people, just worry about what is interesting to you.

This may not make a lot of sense but it was just a short blog post to get the ball rolling.
